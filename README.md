Basic Serverless Lambda using the Serverless Framework & GitHub Actions

IMPORTANT NOTE:

When using '$ serverless create --template aws-nodejs' don't forget to:

1. Make sure node is updated.
2. Access as root and go to the folder of the project.
3. run '$ npm i -g serverless'.
4. run '$ serverless create --template aws-nodejs'.
5. The most important, make sure that if you created your project using Github desktop, the ```.gitignore``` file is not added, cause it has to be created by serverless framework.
